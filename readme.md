deptletter.cls
---

A LaTeX class file for departmental letterheads. Hopefully easy and customizable...

----


###Brief Instructions

First, here's a brief description of the required files:

 - `deptletter.cls` the class file, needs to be in the same directory as your letter.
 - `exampleletter.tex` a sample letter - modify this to make your letter.
 - `logo.pdf` the optional logo to be used for your letterhead. the one supplied is the [official UGA logo](http://styleguide.uga.edu/index.php?/entries/logo_guide_and_downloads).
 - `signature.pdf` is the optional image of a signature. the one supplied says "la la," which may or not be correct for you.

To use the class, just download the above files (although probably not the signature file), and simply modify then `exampleletter.tex` file!
